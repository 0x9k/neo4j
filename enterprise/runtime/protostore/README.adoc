Store API Prototype
===================

This is an abstract base for implementations of the link:../../../community/kernel-api/README.adoc[Kernel API].

The implementation here is based on the link:../cursors/README.adoc[Direct Cursors] prototype.

If this prototype is successful, the abstract base here will form the actual Kernel API, replacing the interfaces defined in `org.neo4j.impl.kernel.api`.
While we still have multiple implementations of those interfaces, we need them to be interfaces.
