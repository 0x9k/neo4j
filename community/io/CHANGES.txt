2.3.0-M03
---------
o Adds commons-lang3 dependency
o Uses vectored I/O for better throughput for flushing pages to underlying storage

2.3.0-M02
---------
o Striped access to FileChannels in SingleFilePageSwapper. This reduces the contention on the synchronized NativeThreadSet inside FileChannelImpl,
  which can become a significant contention point when there's a high page fault rate
o No longer relies on interrupts for page cache shutdown signalling

2.2.1
-----
o Page cache read performance improvements
o Page cache flush performance improvements by ordering individual pages so that
  the mapped files are written sequentially on disk

2.2.0
-----
o Added automatic, continuous background flushing to the PageCache.
o Made the PageCache manage its own background threads
o Made PageSwappers gracefully handle interrupts in force()
