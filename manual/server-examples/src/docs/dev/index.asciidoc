= Extending Neo4j

Neo4j provides a pluggable infrastructure for extensions.
Procedures extend the capabilities of the Cypher query language.
Server plugins and extensions allow new surfaces to be created in the REST API.
All three require the user to be familiar with the Java programming language and to have an environment set up for compiling Java code.
